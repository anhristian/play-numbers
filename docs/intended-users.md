## Intended users and users stories

   * Parents and children who prefer gadgets instead of books and take this as a more interesting way of learning.
 
    > As a parent of a 5-year-old child, I was paying attention to how a lot of parents use tablets and phones with their kids, I thought that creating such an app it will add usefulness to the time children spend on gadgets.

   * Parents who travel a lot and long distances with their children and intend to keep them interested in learning on the way by using a fun environment.

    > As a parent with experience in long flights with a child, I can say that these kinds of travels are not easy to survive. So, even for parents that are not so permissive with gadgets, as I find myself, this educational app is a good way to keep them busy when the parent cannot bring along too many entertainment staff.
